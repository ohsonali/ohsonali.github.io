<h2>Flight Line of the Future</h2>
<h3>This project is centered around streamlining aircraft maintenance at Travis Air Force Base. Presently, the first steps of the maintenance process begin with identifying the malfunctioning part 
on the flight line, and subsequently putting in an order for that part. The current method of ordering a part uses a multitude of platforms and requires inquiry requests 
to different departments before a formal supply order can be submitted. This process can be unwieldy and there is room for improvement to make it more efficient. 
The goal with this project is to automate this complicated process to make it faster and easier for maintenance professionals to order new parts.</h3>
